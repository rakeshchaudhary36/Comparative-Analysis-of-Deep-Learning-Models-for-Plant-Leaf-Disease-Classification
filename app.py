We are a team of five passionate computer engineering students from Khwopa Engineering College, currently in our 8th semester, dedicated to developing a plant leaf disease detection system. Our team consists of:

  * **Oman Neupane:** 760324
  * **Aashish Pandey:** 760302
  * **Rakesh Kumar Chaudhary:** 760330
  * **Ishan Bista:** 760317
  * **Nijal Kachhepati:** 760323
                
Driven by a desire to contribute to the agricultural sector, we embarked on this project to create a user-friendly and effective tool for early detection of plant diseases. Our plant leaf disease detection system leverages the power of computer vision and machine learning to analyze images of leaves and identify potential diseases.

##### **Our Mission:**

Our mission is to empower farmers and agricultural professionals with an innovative and accessible technology that aids in early disease detection. By enabling prompt identification of plant diseases, our system aims to:

* **Increase crop yield and quality by minimizing damage caused by undetected diseases.**
* **Reduce reliance on chemical pesticides by facilitating targeted treatment based on the specific disease identified.**
* **Enhance agricultural sustainability by promoting preventative measures and optimizing resource use.**

##### **Our Approach:**

Our plant leaf disease detection system is designed to be user-friendly and adaptable to various environments. We are committed to:

Developing a user interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate for users of all technical backgrounds.
Training the system on a comprehensive dataset of plant leaf images encompassing a wide range of diseases to ensure accurate detection.
Continuing to refine and improve the system's capabilities through ongoing research and development.

##### **Our Vision:**

We envision a future where our plant leaf disease detection system becomes an essential tool for farmers worldwide, contributing to a more productive, sustainable, and resilient agricultural sector.
#### About Dataset
This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original dataset can be found on this GitHub repo.
This dataset consists of about 87K RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purposes.
    
#### Content
1. Train (70295 images)
2. Test (33 images)
3. Validation (17572 images)
