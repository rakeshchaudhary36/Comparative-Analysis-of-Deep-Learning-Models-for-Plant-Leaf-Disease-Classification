# Project Title 
 Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Plant Leaf Disease Classification using AI and ML <br>
# Project Description
This project evaluates the performance of various deep learning models (ResNet, CNN, DenseNet, VGG16, VGG19) for plant leaf disease classification. The goal is to compare accuracy, training time, and other evaluation metrics to determine the most effective model for plant disease detection.

# Conclusion
Finally EfficientNet model was found to be one of the best performing model similar to ResNet model with only one AUC value below 1.00 and becoming near perfect model. The confusion matrix also showed similar performance to resnet model with maximum values falling under diagonal. This concluded that efficientNet and resnet model were best model for this leaf disease classification tasks.
